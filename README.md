# AOP Modeling

Code to support manuscript

Code is broken down into directories containing python and R code, respectively.  

A MongoDB stores the modeling set data, concentration-response information, etc. Too large to be commited to the github 

Basic workflow order:

1) Identification of ToxCast/Tox21 Assays using Fisher's Exact test - Python
2) KE Model Building - Python
3) Plotting KE model examples - Python
4) Plotting KE Histogram - R
5) Clustering Chemicals - Python
6) Plotting Clusters - R
7) Application with CSS to KE Dose Curves - Python
8) Building ML Models - Python
9) Plotting ML Results - R
10) Plotting False Positive Results - Python
